# lemon-reset
A set of React components that provide Meyer Reset styles for use with CSS Modules.

For all the DOM tags used in Meyer Reset, Lemon-Reset provides a React component with those reset styles, minimizing the effect of browser quirks.
In a React world, we prefer components that are self-contained and unreliant on global styling.
